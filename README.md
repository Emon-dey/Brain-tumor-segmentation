# CMSC691_project
Here I include the necessary codes for the course project CMSC691.

If you want to check a sample code operation with IID setup for a set of specific settings you can go to code/main_code.ipynb.
To run the code from beginning, please follow the following steps:
- Download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/awsaf49/brats20-dataset-training-validation.
- Create two folders named train and val with data and mask folders inside each of them.
- Modify hyperparameters.txt to fit (Adjust the directories).
- Run prepare_dataset.py
- Then run the main_code.ipynb

Some data sample are provided in the 'data' folder. Here you can see the data samples can be found after preprocessing including the mask.
In you want to change the hyperparameter settings, you can change them in config.py.

Please contact me at edey1@umbc.edu if you face any issue setting up the enviorment to run the code.
Thanks.
